Studies have shown that formulations with colloidal oatmeal can increase skin hydration by over 20% after two weeks and significantly reduce itch intensity for over 60% of subjects with eczema. Its ability to restore the skin barrier is quantified by a notable reduction in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL). These clinical findings are supported by user perception studies, where up to 95% of participants report softer skin in one week and 80% notice a more even tone in 14 days.
